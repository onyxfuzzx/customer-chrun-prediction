# 💡 Customer Churn Prediction & Web App

An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts customer churn for a telecommunications company. This repository includes a detailed Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and model training, as well as a **Flask web application** that serves the trained model through an interactive user interface.

## 🚀 Live Demo & Screenshot

The project is deployed as a web application where users can input customer details and receive **real-time churn predictions**.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🖥️ Interactive Web Interface**
  A clean and user-friendly form built using **Flask** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**.

* **📊 Detailed Data Analysis**
  The `customer_churn_pred.ipynb` notebook offers rich exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover business insights.

* **🤖 Robust Model Training**
  Multiple models were evaluated, and a **Random Forest Classifier** was selected as the final model.

* **⚖️ Class Imbalance Handling**
  Implements **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to balance the dataset effectively.

* **🔄 Complete Preprocessing Pipeline**
  Label encoding and scaling with saved encoders (`.pkl`) for consistent inference in production.
